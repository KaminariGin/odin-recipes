    <h1><em>The Overnight Trick for the Easiest Cinnamon Rolls Ever</em> </h1>

    <p> Making homemade cinnamon rolls is a time-consuming process. Between making the dough, letting the dough rise (twice, for that matter), assembling them, and baking, there’s just no way to feasibly make them for breakfast without waking up at the crack of dawn. But overnight cinnamon rolls are a different story: By doing the bulk of the work the night before you can wake up, immediately pop them in the oven, and enjoy warm, ooey-gooey cinnamon rolls in no time.

The problem is that not all cinnamon roll recipes are written that way, so you might think that your go-to recipe can’t be made in advance. Luckily, any cinnamon roll recipe can be turned into an overnight version and without much effort—you just need to know how. Here’s everything you need to know about turning any cinnamon roll recipe into overnight cinnamon rolls. </p>
 
<h1><b> Ingredients</b></h1> <br>
<h1>Dough:</h1>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
    <li>2 eggs, room temperature</li>
    <li>⅓ cup margarine, melted</li>
    <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 ½ teaspoons bread machine yeast</li>
<h1>Filling:</h1> <br>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
    <li>2 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>⅓ cup butter, softened</li>
    <h1>Icing:</h1>
    <li>1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li> <br>
</ul>

    <h1>Steps:</h1>

   <ol> 
<li>Prepare dough: Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start. </li> <br>
    <li>When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes. </li> <br>
    <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x21-inch rectangle. </li> <br>
    <li>Prepare filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top. </li> <br>
    <li>Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. </li> <br>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li> <br>
    <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. </li> <br>
    <li>While rolls are baking, prepare icing: Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until creamy. </li> <br>
    <li>Spread icing on warm rolls before serving. </li> <br>
</ol>
